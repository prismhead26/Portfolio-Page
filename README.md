# Portfolio-Page

## Description

The main goal of this project is to create a webpage from scratch, following accessibility standards. This application will be a Portfolio Webpage, highlighting my hard work and progress to becoming a successful developer.
<br>
After completion of the project, I have a better understanding of Flexbox layouts, media queries, and reset stylesheets. These three components help create a better accessible web application.
